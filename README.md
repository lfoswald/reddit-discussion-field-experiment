# Reddit Political Discussion Field Experiment

This repository contains replication materials for the political discussion field experiment, fielded in summer 2024 (see also associated [OSF project](https://osf.io/m8g4x/)).

The repository is structured as follows:

## Sample descriptives 
Basic demographic information and visualization of survey variables
Reddit metrics (internal and external) 

[`01-sample-descriptives.Rmd`](https://github.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/blob/main/code/01-sample-descriptives.Rmd) / [`01-sample-descriptives.html`](https://raw.githack.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/main/code/01-sample-descriptives.html)

## RQ1 - Discussion participation
Zero hurdle models to describe predictors of individual discussion participation in two parts (continuous comment counts vs. overcoming the zero hurdle); closes with hudle models for different experimental conditions and baseline balance table

[`02-RQ1-participation.Rmd`](https://github.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/blob/main/code/02-RQ1-participation.Rmd) / [`02-RQ1-participation.html`](https://raw.githack.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/main/code/02-RQ1-participation.html)

## RQ2 - Treatment effects
Part one: Effects of experimental conditions on participation distributions, effects on discourse metrics (toxicity and comment length) and effects on political attitude deltas between pre and post surveys 

[`03-RQ2-experiment.Rmd`](https://github.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/blob/main/code/03-RQ2-experiment.Rmd) / [`03-RQ2-experiment.html`](https://raw.githack.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/main/code/03-RQ2-experiment.html)

Part two: Overtime change. Summary effects of treatments on political variable deltas and pooled overtime analyses - change in political variables (trust, polarization, etc.) issue attitudes and issue knowledge; exploration of individual issue opinion trajectories (as exploration of data granularity) 

[`04-opinion-change.Rmd`](https://github.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/blob/main/code/04-opinion-change.Rmd) / [`04-opinion-change.html`](https://raw.githack.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/main/code/04-opinion-change.html)

## Network Analyses
Visualization of comment graphs and user interaction networks, analysis of degree distributions by experimental condition, correlation of user toxicity and interaction network centrality 

[`05-networks.Rmd`](https://github.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/blob/main/code/05-networks.Rmd) / [`05-networks.html`](https://raw.githack.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/main/code/05-networks.html)

## Temporal Models
Analyses of social feedback (examining the effects of up-voting and down-voting on subsequent comment activity) and survival analyses to model discussion dropout. 

[`06-temporal-models.Rmd`](https://github.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/blob/main/code/06-temporal-models.Rmd) / [`06-temporal-models.html`](https://raw.githack.com/lfoswald/reddit-discussion-field-experiment/main/code/06-temporal-models.html)
